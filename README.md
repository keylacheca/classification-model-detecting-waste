# Classification model for detecting waste
### Spring 2020, Universidad de Piura (UDEP) - Deep Learning course

This repo contains an inference stage by developing a functional interface using Python, Starlette, and JS using a classification model for detecting waste materials using Deep Learning and Image Processing, applying a dataset built from scratch. 

Thanks to Javier Seminario and Lenin Morales for their contribution to these project.
